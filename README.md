### Homework Instructions
1. Create a new project;
2. Write Verilog source files (module and testbench), description of the nibbleadd. Saved the Verilog description as q4_xxxxxxx.v, and q4_tb_xxxxxxx.v;
3. The specifications for this module nibbleadd are:
  - Inputs A and B are both 8-bit vector inputs. Output q is 5-bit wide.
  - When ctrl input is ‘0’, output is the sum of lowest 4 bits of A and B.
  - When ctrl input is ‘1’, output is the sum of upper 4 bits of A and B.
